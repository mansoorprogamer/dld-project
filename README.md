A smart dustbin project utilizing IR sensors and a servo motor. This hygienic, contactless dustbin automatically opens and closes when someone approaches. It features a screen that dynamically displays the trash level inside. The system uses four IR sensors: the first sensor controls the lid based on proximity (e.g., when a foot is near), and the other three sensors monitor the trash level and update the screen accordingly. The entire project is coded in Vivado using Verilog and took a significant amount of time to develop.
